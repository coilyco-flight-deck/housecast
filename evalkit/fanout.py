"""Which case pairs a roster edit actually reaches.

A boundary target is generated, so an edit aimed at one pair fans out along
whichever roster field it touches, and only a scoped grant is per-pair. This
answers the question by perturbing one field and re-deriving the board, so the
answer cannot drift from matrix.py the way a second copy of the fan-out rules
would. See docs/evaluation.md and housecast#7173.

The field is addressed on the person snapshot, the same shape `derive` takes,
never on raw roster.yaml: `boundaries`/`scoped_boundaries` are the snapshot's
spelling of `defers`/`scoped` and only exist after housecast/snapshot.py.
