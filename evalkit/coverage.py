"""Report the gap between the board the roster implies and the board that exists.

The board is derived, so a roster edit silently changes which cases exist.
Nothing reported that a boundary was added and its implied cases were never
written, or written and never graded, or that a role was renamed and its graded
evidence went orphaned. This does. See docs/evaluation.md.

It reports and exits zero by default. The gate is deliberate rather than
accidental: the grader is a human by hand, so a blocking check would put every
roster edit behind an annotation session. Flip `blocking` in pyproject.toml.
