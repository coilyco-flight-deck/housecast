"""How many calibration items buy a usable interval on sensitivity and
specificity, for the judge AMENDMENT.md makes the critical path.

attenuation.py answers what an imperfect judge costs once its margins are
known. This answers how many labelled items it takes to know them at all. A
judge whose margins carry a wide interval hands the board a wide interval on
its own size, which is the same as not knowing.

Wilson score interval, which is the right one near 1.0 where the normal
approximation runs off the end of the scale. Four known-answer checks against
published values run first.
