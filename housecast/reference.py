"""The field reference, rendered from the dataclasses rather than typed beside them.

A hand-written reference is a second copy of `housecast/roster.py`, and this repo
has already been bitten by that shape: the version lived in two places and drifted
twice inside one migration, with the tag saying 0.1.3 and the metadata 0.1.1 and
nothing failing. So there is no committed copy at all. `housecast fields` renders
it on demand, off the loaded types and the minimal roster.
