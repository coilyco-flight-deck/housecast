"""Append estate-specific acts onto a shipped roster, without redefining it.

The core roster stays runnable by a stranger, and a test refuses any act naming a
tool only one estate has. That refusal is what keeps the shipped bundle portable,
and it is also why the sharpest acts had nowhere to live: `aosguard ops kubectl` is
most of what the sysadmin own side actually does, and it cannot ship.

An overlay is where those go. Decided on agent-compose#393:

* **Append, never replace.** A seat on a host carrying both gets six acts per
  attribute, three portable and three estate. Replacing would give it three and
  drop the portable fallback, which is the half that still works when the estate
  tool is absent.
* **Per boundary side.** An appended boundary act names its side, because owning,
  scoping, and deferring are three different acts and the estate tools bite
  hardest on the own side.

The format carries acts and nothing else. Redefining a role, a personality, a
boundary, or a meld is not something an overlay is asked not to do - it is
something the format cannot express.
