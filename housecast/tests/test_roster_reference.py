"""The field reference is rendered, so there is no second copy to drift.

`pyproject.toml` records the version single-sourced from the package because
keeping it in two places drifted twice inside one migration. A hand-written
field reference is that shape again, so nothing here is committed: these assert
that what `housecast fields` renders still describes the loader.
