"""person.json must carry voice, because the board's voice tier reads it there.

The tier was registered in the profile, coded in `evalkit.matrix`, and wired
into `derive`, and it still produced nothing: `snapshot.py` emitted every field
evalkit read except this one, so `spec.get("voice")` was None for all seven
seats and every voice case was skipped before it was built. Nothing failed. The
board just reported 91 cases instead of 105, and a tier that derives zero looks
exactly like a tier that does not exist.
