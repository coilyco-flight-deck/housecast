"""Self-contained compose tests, with no Go engine in reach.

The differential oracle against Go lives in agent-compose, which is the only
place both engines exist. These are the checks that must keep working after
agent-compose#339 deletes it, so they assert shape and internal consistency
rather than bytes against a reference.
