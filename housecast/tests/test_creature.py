"""Every role names a creature, and no two name the same one.

The creature is one of the four parts a seat states as its identity, alongside
preferred name, role, and legal name. Two seats answering with the same creature
makes that sentence stop identifying anybody, which is why uniqueness is checked
rather than assumed.

Nothing renders it yet. agent-compose#396 item 4 is the prose rendering, and it
is held behind the parity pin: the Go engine composes the same identity card from
its own KDL, so a new card line has to move in both engines at once.
