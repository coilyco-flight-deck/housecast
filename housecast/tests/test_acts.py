"""Acts, the primitive agent-compose#388 asked for.

An attribute phrased entirely as attitude does not fire, so every role,
personality, and boundary side names three things a seat can actually run. These
mirror the Go loader's checks: the parity suite proves the two engines render
identically, and it cannot prove the roster is complete.
